        "abstract": "Data Visualization plays an important role for patterns and trends analysis in trillion of data rows Big Data analysis, where the data can be represented in some graphical forms. Hence, the data could be more comprehensible in its visual summary in dashboards and storyboards. This study aims to discuss some issues and challenges in visualizing COVID-19 vaccination datasets. There are some possible issues in data visualization, as it is not easy and may be challenging to produce a good dashboard that are interesting and easy for viewers to understand. Therefore, this study focuses on some issues that may arise during performing a data visualization on the COVID-19 dataset. In this study, there are three dashboards have been studied, which are the COVID-19 tracker, its effectiveness, and its acceptance. The first two dataset are derived from Ministry of Health Malaysia bank data, whereas the third dataset is from a survey to support this analysis. The selected attributes are states, the number of people who have received the vaccine as adults, children, and teenagers, and the number of people who already received boosters, and reasons to not get a booster. The visualization issues found within the dashboard are mis-choice of colors, mis-choice of visual object type, lack of interactivity, and plotting too much data. As a result, this proposed alternative solutions for those issues such as color deliberately, pick a suitable visual object, create an interactive dashboard, and reduce the information overload in visualizing the data.",

        "abstract": "Summary We live in a contemporary society surrounded by visuals, which, along with software options and electronic distribution, has created an increased importance on effective scientific visuals. Unfortunately, across scientific disciplines, many figures incorrectly present information or, when not incorrect, still use suboptimal data visualization practices. Presented here are ten principles that serve as guidance for authors who seek to improve their visual message. Some principles are less technical, such as determining the message before starting the visual, while other principles are more technical, such as how different color combinations imply different information. Because figure making is often not formally taught and figure standards are not readily enforced in science, it is incumbent upon scientists to be aware of best practices in order to most effectively tell the story of their data.",

        "abstract": " The visualization of information is a widely used tool to improve comprehension and, ultimately, decision-making in strategic management decisions as well as in a diverse array of other domains. Across social science research, many findings have supported this rationale. However, empirical results vary significantly in terms of the variables and mechanisms studied as well as their resulting conclusion. Despite the ubiquity of information visualization with modern software, there is little effort to create a comprehensive understanding of the powers and limitations of its use. The purpose of this article is therefore to review, systematize, and integrate extant research on the effects of information visualization on decision-making and to provide a future research agenda with a particular focus on the context of strategic management decisions. The study shows that information visualization can improve decision quality as well as speed, with more mixed effects on other variables, for instance, decision confidence. Several moderators such as user and task characteristics have been investigated as part of this interaction, along with cognitive aspects as mediating processes. The article presents integrative insights based on research spanning multiple domains across the social and information sciences and provides impulses for prospective applications in the realm of managerial decision-making.",

        "abstract": "A knowledge-based methodology is proposed for sentiment analysis on social networks. The work was focused on semantic processing taking into account the content handling the public user\u2019s opinions as excerpts of knowledge. Our approach implements knowledge graphs, similarity measures, graph theory algorithms, and a disambiguation process. The results obtained were compared with data retrieved from Twitter and users\u2019 reviews in Amazon. We measured the efficiency of our contribution with precision, recall, and the F-measure, comparing it with the traditional method of looking up concepts in dictionaries which usually assign averages. Moreover, an analysis was carried out to find the best performance for the classification by using polarity, sentiment, and a polarity\u2013sentiment hybrid. A study is presented for arguing the advantage of using a disambiguation process in knowledge processing. A visualization system presents the social graphs to display the sentiment information of each comment as well as the social structure and communications in the network.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Data-driven stories comprise of visualizations and a textual narrative. The two representations coexist and complement each other. Although existing research has explored the design strategies and structure of such stories, it remains an open research question how the two representations play together on a detailed level and how they are linked with each other. In this paper, we aim at understanding the fine-grained interplay of text and visualizations in geographic data-driven stories. We focus on geographic content as it often includes complex spatiotemporal data presented as versatile visualizations and rich textual descriptions. We conduct a qualitative empirical study on 22 stories collected from a variety of news media outlets; 10 of the stories report the COVID-19 pandemic, the others cover diverse topics. We investigate the role of every sentence and visualization within the narrative to reveal how they reference each other and interact. Moreover, we explore the positioning and sequence of various parts of the narrative to find patterns that further consolidate the stories. Drawing from the findings, we discuss study implications with respect to best practices and possibilities to automate the report generation.",

        "abstract": "The automation of business processes and decision making has received major interest from practice and academia. As automation allows us to execute more processes (cases), monitoring automated decision-making is currently evolving into a big data analytics problem for companies. Thus, not only monitoring insights themselves, but also an effective use of such insights become important. In this context , the speed and ability to interpret data is closely related to the visualization of metrics and data. While various approaches for quantitative insights on automated decision-making have been proposed, there is currently no evidence as to how the specific visualization of such metrics helps companies to create more value from their data. In this report, we therefore present the results of an empirical experiment analyzing the cognitive effects of different visualization techniques for quantitative insights on understanding inconsistencies in automated decision-making data",
